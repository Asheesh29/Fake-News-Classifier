# Fake-News-Classifier

FAKE NEWS CLASSIFIER, a Deep Learning Model that is trained over the labeled data and tested with accuracy of 87.30 %. I used concept of Natural Language Processing, Na√Øve Bayes Classification Model, Count Vectorizer, TfidfVectorizer and CNN models to develop this classifier with the help of the  data set of 6335 news articles labeled with FAKE or REAL, for the training purpose I used 33 % of the data set and rest 67 % is used for testing and prediction, and finally came up with the highest accuracy of 87.30 %.

For this project I have used a data set of 6335 news articles labeled with FAKE or REAl lables having 4 attributes Sr.no, Article No, Title and Text.
