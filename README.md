# Fake-News-Classifier

FAKE NEWS CLASSIFIER, a Deep Learning Model that is trained over the labeled data and tested with accuracy of 87.30 %. I used concept of Natural Language Processing, Multinomial Naive bayes Algorithm, Passive Aggresive Classiefier Algorithm and Multinomial Classifier with Hyperparameter to develop this classifier with the help of the data set of 6335 news articles labeled with FAKE or REAL, for the training purpose I used 33 % of the data set and rest 67 % is used for testing and prediction, and finally came up with the highest accuracy of 87.30 %.

For this project I have used a data set of 6335 news articles labeled with FAKE or REAl lables having 4 attributes Sr.no, Article No, Title and Text. Concept of TfidfVectorizer and CountVectorizer is used for the feature selection. I did study over maximum of 5000 features with ngram_range=(1,3).
